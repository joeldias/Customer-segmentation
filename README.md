# Customer-segmentation
This model will assist us in delivering actionable insight to support a client who is a national charitable organization. The client seeks to use the results of a previous postcard mail solicitation for donations to improve outcome in the next campaign. We want to determine which of the individuals in their mailing database have characteristics similar to those of their most profitable donors. By soliciting only these people, our client can spend less money on the solicitation effort and more money on charitable concerns.  
 
We have been provided with two data sets: 

A. Donor Raw Data: this is a historical data, containing previous donor details. Target B column, provides information whether they have donated in past campaign or not. 

B. Prospective Donors: this is a list of new contact; our client is interested in reaching out to in the next campaign they intend to carry out soon.
